# Robin's Coffee Map

This is my coffee map, powered by [@Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) and inspired by [@taniarascia](https://github.com/taniarascia/)'s [Caf√©tography](https://taniarascia.github.io/coffee/). Follow [her tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/real-world-examples-of-map-filter-and-reduce-in-javascript/) to make your own map!

## To do

- [ ] Use OpenStreetMap data instead of manually writing coordinates, opening hours, etc.
- [ ] Add coffee shops!
