# Chiang Mai Coffee Map

Inspired by Tania Rascia's [Chicago Coffee Map](https://github.com/taniarascia/coffee). Follow [her tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/real-world-examples-of-map-filter-and-reduce-in-javascript/) to make your own map!

## Vision

Every expat and nomad in Chiang Mai has an app (most likely Google Maps or Foursquare) where they save their favourite coffee shops for working, relaxing, reading, or simply drinking great coffee.

They exchange some spots with one another, but more often than not these best-coffee-shops lists are kept to oneself.

This map is a crowdsourced best-coffee-shops list that helps locals and visitors alike discover their new favourite coffee shops.
